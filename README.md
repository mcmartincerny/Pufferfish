## How to develop:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/mcmartincerny/Fenix.git
  ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```
  cd Pufferfish
  ```

4. Install the project dependencies using npm:
  ```
  npm install
  ```

5. Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running the following command:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

6. Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the game in action.

That's it! You can now make changes to the code and the development server will automatically reload the game for you.
